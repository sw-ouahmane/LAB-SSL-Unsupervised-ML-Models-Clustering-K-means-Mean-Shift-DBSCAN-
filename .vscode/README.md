# Siamese Neural Network for Unsupervised Learning on MNIST

## 🎓 Project Overview

This project is part of the **Deep Learning Lab** module within the **Machine and Deep Learning and Applications** course, developed during the **Master in Computer Science and Telecommunications (2024/2025)** at the **Faculty of Sciences, Rabat**.

We implement a **Siamese Neural Network** using **PyTorch** to generate embeddings from the MNIST dataset. These embeddings enable the computation of similarity between handwritten digit images and can serve as input for clustering algorithms like **K-Means**.
